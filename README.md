# Gutenberg Search

Exercise the `pg_search` ruby gem to explore the built in fulltext search in postgres.

Example book is [Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt).

* `book.rake` imports a book in the data folder. Hard coded for now and the book data is not parsed out.
